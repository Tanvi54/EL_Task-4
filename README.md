# üõí E-Commerce SQL Data Analysis

## üìå Overview
This project demonstrates **SQL data analysis** on an e-commerce database using **MySQL Workbench**.  
It covers:
- Data extraction with filtering & sorting
- Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
- Subqueries
- Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG)
- Views for reusable analysis
- Indexes for performance optimization

## üóÇ Dataset
Used 2 SQL files( Data Creation  & Data Insertion from https://github.com/mohammadusman666/E-Commerce-Database-Management-System 

The database contains multiple interconnected tables representing a real-world e-commerce system.

|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Customer**     | Stores customer details such as name, contact info, and date of birth. |
| **Country**      | Contains country names for address mapping.                            |
| **Province**     | Stores province/region names.                                          |
| **City**         | Stores city names linked to provinces and countries.                   |
| **ZipCode**      | Stores postal codes with location mappings. |
| **Address**      | Stores customer addresses linked to city, province, and country. |

| **Courier**      | Stores courier/delivery service details. |
| **VendorCourier**| Maps vendors to couriers they use for deliveries. |
| **Orders**       | Stores customer orders with delivery and tracking info. |
| **OrderedProduct**| Stores products included in each order with quantity. |

## üìã Queries Implemented

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY
- Retrieved customers from specific locations, sorted alphabetically.  
- Counted the number of products in each category.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ JOINS (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
- **INNER JOIN:** Displayed orders along with the customer who placed them.  
- **LEFT JOIN:** Listed all customers, showing order details if available.  
- **RIGHT JOIN:** Listed all vendors with the products they sell.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Subqueries
- Found products priced **above the average price** in the database.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Aggregate Functions (SUM, AVG)
- Calculated **total** and **average** quantity ordered per customer.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Views for Analysis
- Created a view `TopSellingProducts` to quickly check which products sell the most.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Optimizing Queries with Indexes
- Added indexes on frequently used columns like `CustomerID` in Orders and `ProductID` in VendorProduct to improve query performance.

## üì¢ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to effectively **query and analyze** an e-commerce dataset using SQL.  
By applying **joins, subqueries, aggregates, views, and indexes**, we can extract meaningful insights and improve performance. üöÄ
